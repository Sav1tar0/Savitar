### Adding Your Own Data

1. Open `exam-results.html` in a text editor
2. Find the `examResults` array in the JavaScript section (around line 265)
3. Replace the sample data with your actual exam results:

```javascript
const examResults = [
    { 
        code: 'CS101', 
        name: 'Computer Science Fundamentals', 
        credits: 4, 
        marks: 92, 
        grade: 'A', 
        gradePoints: 4.0 
    },
    // Add more subjects here...
];
```

### Updating Student Information

Find the `updateStudentInfo` function call near the end of the JavaScript and uncomment/modify it:

```javascript
updateStudentInfo('Your Name', 'Your ID', '2023-2024', 'Fall 2024');
```

### Customizing Colors

- Info cards: `#f093fb` to `#f5576c`
- Grade colors: Each grade has its own gradient

### Adding More Subjects

```javascript
{
    code: 'SUBJECT_CODE',
    name: 'Subject Full Name',
    credits: 3,
    marks: 85,
    grade: 'B',
    gradePoints: 3.0
}
```

    credits: number,     // Credit hours for the subject

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Server Won't Start
- Make sure Python 3 is installed
- Check if port 8000 is available
- Try running `python run_server.py` instead of `python3`

### Page Not Loading
- Ensure `exam-results.html` is in the same directory as the server script
- Check your browser's developer console for errors

### Calculations Seem Wrong
- Verify that `gradePoints` match your institution's grading scale
- Ensure `credits` are correctly entered for each subject
